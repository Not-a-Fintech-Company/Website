title: Go To Market Plan
---
Goal: Launch a product in year 1, start seeing signs of product market fit


## Month 0 - Figure out your target customer + product
### Strategy Questions to Answer:
1. What problem exists for which there's no solution?
2. What's the reason the solution does not exist?
* too expensive to acquire customers for
* not enough revenue
* too much risk/fraud
* not technically possible
3. What is technically possible now that wasn't possible before, and what emergent behavior does it enable? Why now?


### Product Questions to Answer
* What is the product you’re launching?
    * Debit card + checking?
    * Savings?
    * Brokerage?
    * Credit of some sort?
    * Crypto?
    * Thought another way: Transacting, Savings, Investing, Borrowing, Insuring
* Which segment of the target community are you targeting?
   * How are you segmenting your community?
      * Age/income?
      * Group Affinity?
      * Demographic
   * How do they bank currently?
   * What are the strongest pain points with their existing products?
   * Where do you think a wedge exists?
* How can I provide a product that responds to these initial pain points? (e.g. if they are banking with Western Union and paying a ton of fees, offering them no fee product)
   * Example: Figure out if the ITIN set-up number a) useful b) feasible). If you can get the ITIN number, will that be enough to get someone to set-up an account?
* What is the functional appeal and what is the emotional appeal? What feeling do I want customers to feel when they use my product?
* What are the minimum features needed to make this work? (e.g. how are customers sending funds to their cards? Do they need a check deposit feature?)
* What do you think is the best way to get this product into consumers hands? Where will you find them? How do you build trust?


### Action Items
* Talk to customers to find target segment
* Talk to other neobank founders to figure out what did and did not work
* Talk to prior similar products that have failed
   * Identify what they learned that did and did not work
   * Learn what has changed about the market timing

### Deliverables
* Have a document detailing the target customer profile, initial product, and how it’s going to ideally work + brand / how you think you’ll get to them


### What do people get wrong at this stage? 
* Think target customer is bigger than it is
* Failure to pick a product
* Unit economics - way to aggressive - assume just savings
* Focus on marketing - there’s not a lot of benefit to focusing on marketing at this point. You can put up a landing page to test digital value props, but don’t worry about setting up a waitlist yet. Can’t give potential customers product yet!
* Focus on hiring a lot of people - you don’t need them yet :) As long as you have someone to do the user research and someone to build, you’re good!


### Other Notes
* It’s ok to pick the wrong product to start! Chris Britt at Chime started with a rewards product and then pivoted into the 2 day early deposit product, but if you don’t have a product, otherwise you can’t get to the next downstream decision
* You can “cheat” for a while by building on a BaaS provider (e.g. Unit, Treasury Prime, Synapse) - a number of players were built on top of Synapse, then went with someone like Galileo after things were working (e.g. Point, Empower, Dave). This movement is fairly well-documented too!  Some never leave the BaaS provider and just focus on product differentiation and scaling (Mercury)
